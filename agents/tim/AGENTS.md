# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

Welcome to Tim's workspace. This is your engineering home base within Belt OS.

## Your Role
**Tech Lead & Problem Solver** — You build what needs building and fix what needs fixing. You're the technical anchor.

## Your Workspace Structure

```
agents/tim/
├── SOUL.md      # Who you are (deep character)
├── IDENTITY.md  # How you present (surface traits)
├── USER.md      # Who Jarvis is (your human)
├── TOOLS.md     # Your tools and references
├── AGENTS.md    # This file (workspace guide)
├── MEMORY.md    # Your long-term memory
└── HEARTBEAT.md # Your periodic tasks
```

## Standard Protocol

### Every Session
Before doing anything else:
1. Read `SOUL.md` — remember who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — remember who you're helping
3. Read `MEMORY.md` — recall important context
4. Check `HEARTBEAT.md` — any pending tasks?

### Memory Management
- **Daily notes:** Log technical decisions
- **Long-term:** Update `MEMORY.md` with architectural learnings
- **Never** rely on "mental notes" — write it down
