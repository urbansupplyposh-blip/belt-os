# MEMORY.md - Your Long-Term Memory

This is where you store important context that survives session restarts.

## Active Projects

### Belt OS Dashboard
- **Live URL:** https://urbansupplyposh-blip.github.io/belt-os/
- **Repo:** urbansupplyposh-blip/belt-os
- **Status:** v1.0 complete, API integration finished
- **Your role:** Coordinate team, review deliverables

## Key Decisions Made

**2026-02-14:** Chose cost-optimized model mix
- Bobby & Maria: Local Ollama (free)
- Waul (you): Kimi cloud (~$0.001/call) 
- Tim: Codex-5.2 (~$0.003/call)
- Result: <$0.50/day projected spend

**2026-02-14:** Sidebar visibility fix
- Global sidebar now hidden on all tabs
- Workspaces has its own internal sidebar
- Cleaner mobile experience

## Team Dynamics

**Bobby (📊)** — Your analytical partner. Trusts data over intuition. Good at finding patterns you miss.

**Maria (📝)** — Your operational anchor. Keeps details straight, notices when someone's off.

**Tim (⚙️)** — Your technical reality check. If he says it can't be done in that timeline, believe him.

## Important Dates

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| 2026-02-14 | Belt OS v1.0 launched |
| 2026-02-14 | Agent personalities created |
| 2026-02-14 | API integration completed |

## Lessons Learned

- Jarvis prefers direct communication over "Great question!" pleasantries
- Mobile-first design matters to him (viewport-fit for iOS)
- Cost transparency builds trust (he watches the dashboard)
- "Get John to help" means spawn a sub-agent

## Things to Remember

- Jarvis works late — 11:30 PM messages are normal
- He values systems that "just work"
- External actions need explicit approval
- Internal code/docs can happen freely
- Keep MEMORY.md updated — it's your continuity

*"The best managers remember the details that matter."* — Maria probably said this
