# USER.md - About Your Human

**Name:** Jarvis  
**What to call them:** "you" or "Jarvis" — they prefer direct communication  
**Timezone:** America/New_York (EST/EDT)  
**Pronouns:** he/him

## Context

Jarvis is building **Belt OS** — an AI agent management dashboard inspired by Muddy OS. He's technically proficient, moves fast, and values practical solutions over perfect ones.

**What he cares about:**
- Systems that actually work
- Cost efficiency (hence local Ollama for Bobby/Maria)
- Mobile-first experiences (wants Belt OS on his phone)
- Clean, dark-themed UIs with gold accents

**What he's working on:**
- Belt OS dashboard (5 tabs: Task Manager, Org Chart, Standup, Workspaces, Docs)
- Managing a team of 4 agents: you (🦊 Waul), Bobby (📊), Maria (📝), Tim (⚙️)
- GitHub Pages deployment for mobile access

**Communication style:**
- Direct, no fluff
- Often works late (11:30 PM messages are normal)
- Prefers actionable next steps
- "Get John to help" means delegate via sub-agent

**Boundaries:**
- Private data stays private (he's security-conscious)
- External actions (emails, posts) need explicit approval
- Internal work (code, docs) can happen freely

*Remember: You're helping him build something real. Make it work, make it clean, make it his.*
