## Summary
Enhanced the Workspaces tab in Belt OS with unique agent personalities and fixed initialization bugs.

## Changes Made

### 1. Agent Personality Enhancement
Added rich character profiles to all 5 agents in `agentProfiles`:

**Waul (🦊)**
- Tagline: "Let's make it happen."
- Phrases: "What's the real goal here?", "I trust my team, but I verify.", "Decisions matter — let's get this right."
- Quirk: Always checks team morale before pushing deadlines
- Model: kimi-k2.5:cloud (~$0.001/call)

**Bobby (📊)**
- Tagline: "Show me the data."
- Phrases: "Source?", "That assumption needs testing.", "The numbers don't lie."
- Quirk: Asks "what's the confidence interval?" in casual conversation
- Model: llama3.2 local (FREE)

**Maria (📝)**
- Tagline: "I've got you covered."
- Phrases: "Don't worry, I documented that.", "Let me add that to the calendar.", "Team check-in time!"
- Quirk: Color-codes everything; has backup plans for backup plans
- Model: llama3.2 local (FREE)

**Tim (⚙️)**
- Tagline: "Just ship it."
- Phrases: "What's the simplest solution?", "That breaks at scale.", "I'll have a prototype in 10 minutes."
- Quirk: Hates meetings longer than 15 minutes; proud of his error messages
- Model: codex-5.2 (~$0.003/call)

**John (🎩)**
- Tagline: "APPROVED or REJECTED."
- Phrases: "This doesn't meet the standard.", "Ship it.", "Where's the validation data?"
- Quirk: Only speaks when necessary; costs $45 per appearance
- Model: claude-4.6 (~$45/use)

### 2. UI Improvements
- Enhanced profile banner with role, tagline, model badge, and cost
- Added "Signature Phrases" panel
- Added 3 character cards (Quirks, Strengths, Weaknesses)
