# Session Log - 2026-02-14 (Evening)

## Major Accomplishment: Belt OS v1.0 Complete

### What Was Built
Complete replication of "Muddy OS" (AI agent dashboard) tailored for the Belt team:
- **Live URL:** https://urbansupplyposh-blip.github.io/belt-os/
- **5 tabs:** Task Manager, Org Chart, Standup, Workspaces, Docs
- **4 agents:** Waul (🦊), Bobby (📊), Maria (📝), Tim (⚙️)
- **Design:** Exact Muddy OS dark theme with gold accents

### Agent Personalities Created
Each agent now has unique SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md:

| Agent | Personality | Role |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Waul | Warm strategist, decisive but empathetic | Manager |
| Bobby | Dry data detective, skeptical, evidence-based | Analyst |
| Maria | Nurturing organizer, detail-obsessed but kind | Bookkeeper |
| Tim | Pragmatic engineer, direct, no-nonsense | Tech Lead |

### Technical Implementation
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build step)
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Mobile-responsive
- Cost tracking module (localStorage)
- API bridge for agent endpoints
- Sidebar only visible in Workspaces tab

### Reference Images Analyzed
Analyzed all 10 Muddy OS screenshots via Claude API:
- 4 Task Manager images
- 2 Org Chart images  
- 2 Executive Standup images
- 2 Agent Workspaces images

### Files Created
- `index.html` - Complete Belt OS UI
- `cost-monitor.js` - Real-time cost tracking
- `belt-api.js` - API integration
- `agents/{waul,bobby,maria,tim}/SOUL.md` - Agent personalities
- `agents/{waul,bobby,maria,tim}/IDENTITY.md` - Agent identities
- `BELTOS_BRIEFING_WAUL.md` - Executive briefing
- `FEATURES.md` - Feature documentation

### Cost Structure
- Bobby & Maria: FREE (local Ollama)
- Waul: ~$0.001/call (Kimi cloud)
- Tim: ~$0.003/call (Codex 5.2)
- Projected daily: <$0.50

### API Integration Completed (11:30 PM)
Sub-agent completed full API bridge enhancement:
- Error handling with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Request/response logging with localStorage persistence
- Cost tracking integrated with real API responses
- "Send Message" modal in Task Manager (agent selection + team messaging)
- API Test Panel with connection tests and health reports
- All changes pushed to GitHub

### Complete Agent Document Sets (11:32 PM)
All 4 agents now have full document suites:
- **SOUL.md** - Deep personality/character
- **IDENTITY.md** - Surface traits and voice
- **USER.md** - Who Jarvis is (from agent's perspective)
- **TOOLS.md** - Agent-specific tools and references
- **AGENTS.md** - Workspace guide and team structure
- **MEMORY.md** - Long-term context and learnings
- **HEARTBEAT.md** - Periodic tasks and checks

Each agent has unique perspective on their role and the team.

### Documentation Rewrite (11:41 PM)
User requested removal of "carbon copy of Muddy OS" language and addition of depth:
- Complete rewrite of Docs tab content
- Added Core Philosophy section (agents as team members, not chatbots)
- Detailed Operational Model (cost transparency, session persistence, communication patterns)
- Technical Implementation details (deployment architecture, data model, mobile-first design)
- Security & Boundaries section
- Future Development roadmap (voice standups, iMessage integration, cron jobs, multi-team support)
- Proper Getting Started instructions

### Org Chart Redesign (11:45 PM)
User requested multi-manager structure - everyone promoted with subagents:
- **4 Manager tabs** added: Waul, Bobby, Maria, Tim
- Each manager has **3 subagents** (12 total agents now)

**Waul's Team (Strategy):**

- Sift 🔍 - Data mining, validation
- Radar ⚠️ - Anomaly detection, warnings

**Maria's Team (Operations):**
- Clerk 📋 - Filing, archives, search
- Clock 📅 - Calendar, reminders, deadlines
- Ledger 💰 - Budgets, costs, tracking

**Tim's Team (Engineering):**
- Squash 🐛 - Bug hunting, fixes, testing
- Ship 🚀 - CI/CD, releases, rollbacks
- Vault 🔐 - Auth, secrets, compliance

### Org Chart Bug Fix (11:43 PM)
Tab switching wasn't working — added:
- Proper CSS for `.org-tabs`, `.org-tab`, `.org-tab.active`
- Error handling in `selectManagerTab()` function
- Console logging for debugging
- `initOrgChart()` initialization function

### John (VP) Operational (11:45 PM)
User requested to get John operating again. John was previously marked as "AVOIDED" but is now fully operational:

**Setup Complete:**
- Agent directory: `/Users/jarvis/.openclaw/agents/john/`
- All 7 documents created: SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md, TOOLS.md, AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, HEARTBEAT.md
- OpenClaw gateway config updated (agent id: "john", model: "default")
- Belt OS dashboard updated with 5th manager tab

**John's Profile:**
- **Name:** John
- **Role:** VP (Vice President) - Final Quality Gate
- **Model:** Claude 4.6 (OpenClaw default)
- **Cost:** ~$0.045/call (expensive, used sparingly)
- **Emoji:** 🎩
- **Reports to:** Don (CEO)
- **Participates:** Type B meetings only (final approval)

**John's Team:**
- Scope 🔎 - Review Agent (final checks, standards, gate)
- Score 📊 - Criteria Agent (rubrics, metrics, benchmarks)
- Stamp ✅ - Approval Agent (sign-offs, records, archive)

**Dashboard Updates:**
- Task Manager: Added John agent card with "On Call" status
- Org Chart: 5 manager tabs now (Waul, Bobby, Maria, Tim, John)
- Stats updated: 5 Managers, 15 Total Agents
- Workspaces: John workspace accessible with all 7 documents
- API Bridge: John endpoint at localhost:8087/john
- Cost Monitor: John tracked at ~$0.045/call

### John's Activation Rule (11:47 PM)
**Critical constraint:** John only comes in when Don explicitly asks for him. No heartbeats, no automatic participation, no routine tasks. He stays dormant until summoned.

- Heartbeat: **DISABLED** (confirmed via `openclaw status`)
- Activation: Manual only (when Don calls)
- State: Waiting, ready, silent until called

### Verification (11:47 PM)
- `openclaw status` confirms: 6 agents, John's heartbeat disabled
- `openclaw doctor --fix` cleaned up config (removed invalid description key)
- John operational on Claude Opus 4.6 with 200k context

### Next Steps (Pending)
- Get Waul's feedback on dashboard
- Test John agent endpoint
- Add real cron monitoring jobs
- Integrate iMessage notifications
- Consider voice standup feature
