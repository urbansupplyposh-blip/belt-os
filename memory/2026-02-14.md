## iMessage Setup Complete

Successfully configured iMessage integration for OpenClaw two-way chat.

### What Was Done
1. Found BlueBubbles app running on port 1234
2. Retrieved config from `~/Library/Application Support/bluebubbles-server/config.db`
3. BlueBubbles password: `Cookies11!`
4. Had to work around BlueBubbles plugin schema error (used built-in iMessage channel instead)
5. Enabled iMessage channel via OpenClaw config

### Configuration Applied
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "imessage": {
      "enabled": true,
      "dmPolicy": "pairing",
      "groupPolicy": "allowlist"
    }
  }
}
```

### Test Results
- ✅ iMessage channel showing as ON and configured in status
- ✅ Test message sent successfully to Don (+16462499616)
- Channel uses `imsg` CLI which has Full Disk Access permissions

### Next Steps for User
1. Reply to the test message from iMessage
2. I'll receive it in pairing mode and can approve the conversation
3. Once approved, two-way chat works like webchat

### Technical Notes
- BlueBubbles plugin has a schema compatibility issue (`schema.toJSONSchema is not a function`)
- Using built-in iMessage plugin as fallback (also uses Messages.app)
- Both plugins require same macOS permissions (Full Disk Access for Messages database)
