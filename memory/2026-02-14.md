## Major Accomplishment: Belt OS v1.0 Complete

### What Was Built
Complete replication of "Muddy OS" (AI agent dashboard) tailored for the Belt team:
- **Live URL:** https://urbansupplyposh-blip.github.io/belt-os/
- **5 tabs:** Task Manager, Org Chart, Standup, Workspaces, Docs
- **4 agents:** Waul (🦊), Bobby (📊), Maria (📝), Tim (⚙️)
- **Design:** Exact Muddy OS dark theme with gold accents

### Agent Personalities Created
Each agent now has unique SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md:

| Agent | Personality | Role |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Waul | Warm strategist, decisive but empathetic | Manager |
| Bobby | Dry data detective, skeptical, evidence-based | Analyst |
| Maria | Nurturing organizer, detail-obsessed but kind | Bookkeeper |
| Tim | Pragmatic engineer, direct, no-nonsense | Tech Lead |

### Technical Implementation
- Pure HTML/CSS/JS (no build step)
- GitHub Pages hosting
- Mobile-responsive
- Cost tracking module (localStorage)
- API bridge for agent endpoints
- Sidebar only visible in Workspaces tab

### Reference Images Analyzed
Analyzed all 10 Muddy OS screenshots via Claude API:
- 4 Task Manager images
- 2 Org Chart images  
- 2 Executive Standup images
- 2 Agent Workspaces images

### Cost Structure

- Tim: ~$0.003/call (Codex 5.2)
- Projected daily: <$0.50

### API Integration Completed (11:30 PM)
Sub-agent completed full API bridge enhancement:
- Error handling with retry logic (3 attempts, exponential backoff)
- Request/response logging with localStorage persistence
- Cost tracking integrated with real API responses
- "Send Message" modal in Task Manager (agent selection + team messaging)

### Next Steps (Pending)
