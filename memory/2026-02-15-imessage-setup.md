[Sat 2026-02-14 21:19 EST] what did you get working
[message_id: 21de2cd6-f61e-4960-a81a-fe0407ff92c6]
assistant:       Here's what's working:

**✅ iMessage CLI (`imsg`)**
- Installed and fully functional
- Successfully sent a test message to Don (+16462499616)
- Can list chats, view history, and send messages

**✅ BlueBubbles Server**
- Installed and running
- Full Disk Access permission granted
- App is open and showing the setup wizard

**⚠️ Still needed:**
- Complete the BlueBubbles setup wizard (currently on "Intro" step, need to reach "Connection" step)
- Configure the webhook URL so OpenClaw can receive your iMessages
- Enable the BlueBubbles plugin in OpenClaw config

The UI automation is a bit finicky. Want me to try a different approach - I could configure BlueBubbles by editing its config files directly instead of clicking through the wizard?
user: [Sat 2026-02-14 21:25 EST] check if everything is set up and then let me know when I can iMessage you

assistant:  Let me check BlueBubbles' config and enable the plugin:  
user: [Sat 2026-02-14 21:26 EST] let me know
